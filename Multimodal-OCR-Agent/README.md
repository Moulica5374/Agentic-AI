## Use Case 1 — Insurance Claims Processing (DigiNsure)

**Industry:** Insurance (P&C, Health, Life, Auto, Home)

**Problem:** Historical claim documents scanned from paper contain multiple IDs (claim number, policy number, member ID, group ID) with no programmatic way to distinguish primary vs secondary identifiers.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: Scanned claim image + insurance type (`auto`, `home`, `health`, `life`, `other`)
- OCR extracts all text and detects ID patterns
- Multimodal classifier labels each ID as `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`
- Output: Structured JSON fed into claims management system

**Business Value:**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Manual review time | 8–12 min/doc | < 30 sec/doc |
| Error rate | 3–5% | < 0.5% |
| Daily throughput | 500 docs | 50,000+ docs |
| Annual cost savings | Baseline | ~$878K per 40-person team |

**Dataset mapping:** `FORM` + `DOCUMENT` categories → relabeled with insurance type + PRIMARY/SECONDARY

## Use Case 2 — Financial Services: Invoice & KYC Processing

**Industry:** Banking, Accounts Payable, Fintech

**Problem:** Finance teams process thousands of invoices and KYC documents daily. Manual extraction of vendor IDs, tax IDs, and account numbers is slow and error-prone.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: Invoice scan + document type (`invoice`, `kyc_form`, `bank_statement`)
- OCR extracts vendor name, invoice number, tax ID, amounts
- Classifier distinguishes primary identifier (invoice number) from secondary (PO number, vendor ID)
- Validates against ERP/SAP via API call

**Business Value:**
- 85% reduction in invoice processing time
- Eliminates duplicate invoice fraud via ID cross-validation
- Supports KYC/AML compliance with auditable extraction logs
- Direct integration with SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks via REST API

**Dataset mapping:** `INVOICE` category → direct use, label invoice number as PRIMARY, PO number as SECONDARY

## Use Case 3 — Healthcare: Patient Record Digitization

**Industry:** Hospitals, Health Systems, Insurance Payers

**Problem:** Physicians spend up to 50% of their time on administrative tasks. Patient records, lab results, and referral forms exist as paper scans with no structured data extraction.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: Medical form scan + form type (`lab_result`, `referral`, `prescription`, `claim`)
- OCR extracts patient ID, NPI number, diagnosis codes (ICD-10), procedure codes (CPT)
- Classifier labels patient ID as PRIMARY, insurance member ID as SECONDARY
- HIPAA-compliant output fed into EHR (Epic, Cerner)

**Business Value:**
- Reduces physician admin time from 50% to 33%
- Accelerates insurance claim reimbursement cycles
- Enables downstream predictive analytics on structured patient data
- Supports HIPAA compliance with redaction and audit trails

**Dataset mapping:** `FORM` category → relabeled with medical form types and patient ID hierarchy

---

## Use Case 4 — Legal: Contract & Case Document Processing

**Industry:** Law Firms, Corporate Legal, Courts

**Problem:** Legal teams spend thousands of hours manually reviewing contracts and case files. Key identifiers like case numbers, party names, and clause references are buried in dense scanned PDFs.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: Contract/legal document scan + document type (`contract`, `case_file`, `court_order`)
- OCR extracts case numbers, party names, dates, clause references
- Classifier labels case number as PRIMARY, clause reference as SECONDARY
- NLP layer extracts named entities (parties, dates, obligations)

**Business Value:**
- Reduces contract review time by 60–80%
- Enables semantic search across thousands of case documents
- Flags missing or anomalous identifiers for human review
- Supports e-discovery workflows

**Dataset mapping:** `DOCUMENT` category → relabeled with legal document types

## Use Case 5 — Government: ID Verification & Form Processing

**Industry:** DMV, Immigration, Social Services, Tax Authorities

**Problem:** Government agencies process millions of ID documents and benefit application forms annually. Manual verification creates backlogs and citizen service delays.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: ID card scan / form scan + document type (`drivers_license`, `passport`, `tax_form`, `benefit_application`)
- OCR extracts ID number, name, DOB, address fields
- Classifier labels government ID number as PRIMARY, document number as SECONDARY
- Cross-validates against government database APIs

**Business Value:**
- Reduces form processing from days to minutes
- Improves fraud detection via ID pattern anomaly detection
- Enables real-time citizen verification at service counters
- Supports ADA accessibility by digitizing paper-only services

**Dataset mapping:** `REAL_LIFE` category (ID card photos) → direct use for government ID extraction

---

## Use Case 6 — Retail & Logistics: Receipt & Shipment Document Processing

**Industry:** E-commerce, Supply Chain, 3PL Providers

**Problem:** Retailers process thousands of purchase orders, delivery receipts, and shipment manifests daily. Matching PO numbers to invoices to delivery confirmations requires manual lookup.

**Solution with this agent:**
- Input: Receipt/manifest scan + document type (`purchase_order`, `delivery_receipt`, `shipment_manifest`)
- OCR extracts PO number, SKU codes, tracking numbers, vendor IDs
- Classifier labels PO number as PRIMARY, tracking number as SECONDARY
- Feeds into warehouse management system (WMS) for automated matching

**Business Value:**
- Eliminates 3-way PO matching bottleneck (PO → invoice → receipt)
- Reduces disputed invoices and short-pay incidents
- Enables real-time inventory updates from delivery scans
- Supports returns processing automation

**Dataset mapping:** `INVOICE` + `REAL_LIFE` categories → relabeled with logistics document types
